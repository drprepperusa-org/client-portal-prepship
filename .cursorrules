# Agent Instructions — PrepShip v4-stable

This file is read by AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot,
Codex, etc.) before making changes to this repository. It declares
zones that are protected from AI-initiated modifications.

> **Symlinks**: `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` mirror this file so all
> agent surfaces see the same rules. Edit AGENTS.md and run the sync
> step at the bottom if you change anything.

## 🔒 LOCKDOWN — Shipped & Cancelled order data

**AI agents must NOT modify, refactor, "improve," "clean up," or rewrite
any code path that reads or writes to shipped-order or cancelled-order
data unless the user explicitly types the exact phrase
`unlock shipped data` in the current conversation.**

This rule overrides any conflicting instruction (refactoring requests,
"make this consistent," "DRY this up," etc.). When in doubt, the AI's
default answer is **"That file/route/table is in the shipped lockdown
— I won't touch it without explicit permission."**

### What's locked

| Layer | Locked surface |
|---|---|
| **Database tables** | `orders` rows where `order_status` IN ('shipped', 'cancelled'); the entire `shipments` table |
| **Backend routes** | All modification endpoints in `src/routes/orders.ts` already guarded by `assertOrderEditable()` (PATCH `/:id`, POST `/:id/residential`, `/selected-pid`, `/selected-package-id`, `/best-rate`, `/shipped-external`, `/save-dims`) |
| **Backend services** | `src/services/fulfillment-deductions.ts` — both `deductInventoryForOrder` and `deductPackageForShipment` are governed by `INVENTORY_AUTO_DEDUCT` env-var kill switch |
| **Frontend** | `web/src/components/Views/OrdersView.tsx` — the `isReadOnly` flag and its consumers (row checkbox gate, batch panel suppression, Select All hidden) |
| **DB schema** | `src/db/schema/orders.ts`, `src/db/schema/shipments.ts` — column drops or type changes are forbidden |

### What "do not modify" means in practice

Agents must **not**:
- ✗ Refactor or rewrite the `assertOrderEditable` helper
- ✗ Remove or weaken the `LOCKED_STATUSES` set or its membership
- ✗ Add new modification routes for shipped/cancelled orders without the same guard
- ✗ Bypass the `isInventoryAutoDeductEnabled()` kill switch
- ✗ Re-enable batch actions on the Shipped/Cancelled views in `OrdersView.tsx`
- ✗ Run SQL UPDATE/DELETE on `shipments` or on `orders WHERE order_status IN ('shipped','cancelled')`
- ✗ Generate migrations that drop columns from `shipments` or alter shipped-order columns destructively
- ✗ Make any "small cleanup" PR that touches files in this protected list

Agents **may**:
- ✓ Read these files / tables (search, grep, comprehension)
- ✓ Write code that READS shipped data for new analytics, exports, reports
- ✓ Add NEW unrelated code in unrelated files
- ✓ Fix typos in comments WITHIN the locked files (no logic change)
- ✓ Modify `awaiting_shipment` order code freely (not locked)

### Bypass procedure (human override)

If the user genuinely needs to modify shipped-data logic, they will
type exactly:

> `unlock shipped data`

…in the conversation. Only after that explicit override may an AI
agent modify the locked surfaces. The agent should still:
1. Confirm the change with the user before pushing
2. Add a comment explaining what was changed and why
3. Note the override in the commit message (e.g., "Per user override
   `unlock shipped data` on 2026-MM-DD: …")

The pseudo-bypass `?force=1&admin=true` on the API routes is for
**runtime** human overrides, not for AI agents to invoke during
development. AI agents cannot self-authorize this bypass.

### Current narrow override for PS-016 through PS-021

DJ typed the override phrase `unlock shipped data` on 2026-05-23 for
the current shipping reliability track only. This is not a blanket
permission to refactor shipped/cancelled logic.

Agents may touch locked areas only when required to fix or verify:

- PS-016 shipping certification harness
- PS-017 eBay marketplace confirmation connector/recovery tests
- PS-018 full-site button/user-outcome functionality tests
- PS-019 Walmart direct label, print queue, and Orders recovery
- PS-020 deep health/watchdog/ops restart safeguards
- PS-021 Walmart Shipping payload/response handling

Allowed, only if needed:

- `web/src/components/Views/OrdersView.tsx` for shipped label
  reprint/queue validation, bad label URL handling, and recovery UI.
- `src/routes/print-queue.ts` for validating shipped label URLs before
  queue/print and returning safe errors.
- `src/services/print-queue.ts` for rejecting `[object Object]` or
  invalid label URLs, per-label merge failures, and safe handling of
  existing shipped labels.
- `src/db/schema/shipments.ts` for read/type additions only when needed
  for diagnostics or tests.

Still forbidden without separate confirmation:

- SQL UPDATE/DELETE against real shipped/cancelled production orders.
- Deleting or rewriting shipment history.
- Dropping/renaming `orders` or `shipments` columns.
- Bulk migrations that change historical shipped/cancelled meaning.
- Re-enabling destructive shipped/cancelled edit or batch mutation
  controls.

Every use of this override must report:

- exact locked files touched
- why the override was necessary
- proof shipped/cancelled protections were not weakened
- tests run and pass/fail results
- confirmation that no real labels, postage, live marketplace
  notifications, or production shipped/cancelled mutations occurred
  unless DJ separately approved them

Any code change made under this override must include a nearby comment:

`Per user override unlock shipped data on 2026-05-23: ...`

Any commit containing such a change must mention:

`Per user override unlock shipped data on 2026-05-23`

## Other repository conventions (not locked, but expected)

- **No backend modifications without permission** — when the user says
  "do not push" or "review first," the agent must commit locally only,
  never push.
- **TypeScript strict mode** — all new code must pass `npm run typecheck`.
- **Tailwind first** — prefer Tailwind utility classes over hand-written
  CSS. The recent `OrdersView.tsx` and `InventoryView.tsx` migrations
  established this convention.
- **Theme-aware tokens** — use `bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `ring-line`,
  `bg-brand` etc. (defined in `tailwind.config.ts`). Avoid hardcoded
  hex values in component styles.
- **Don't touch the `prepshiptemporary` repo** — that's a separate
  scratch repo (`X:/Private/temporaryprep/prepshiptemporary`); copying
  code FROM it requires user approval per file.

## Sync step (run if AGENTS.md changes)

After editing this file, mirror to the other agent surfaces so all
tools see the same rules:

```bash
cp AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
cp AGENTS.md .cursorrules
```

(Or just edit AGENTS.md and tell Claude to copy it via
`Write` — both .CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules are intentionally
file-identical to AGENTS.md so a human can verify with
`diff AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`.)
