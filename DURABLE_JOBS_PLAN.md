# PrepShip Durable Jobs Plan

## Executive Summary

This Phase 11/12 deliverable defines how PrepShip should move user-visible and operational background jobs from mixed in-memory state toward durable, restart-safe job state. The goal is to prevent lost progress, duplicate work, confusing stuck states, and repeated external API calls when Render restarts or scales.

The first low-risk implementation is now in place for ShipStation Awaiting parity: the reconciliation script persists its latest dry-run/apply summary to `settings` at `shipstation_awaiting_parity.last_run`. Best-rate backfill also persists its latest run snapshot to `settings` at `rate_backfill_best_rates.last_run`, and `/rates/backfill-best/latest` exposes the memory job plus durable snapshot for support/status checks. Billing reference-rate fetch follows the same pattern with `billing_ref_rates_fetch.last_run` included in `/billing/fetch-ref-rates/status`. Print queue batch-send and PDF-merge jobs now persist scoped latest-run snapshots to `settings` and include a matching `durableJob` on their status responses. These give support and future status panels durable audit points without changing label purchase, shipped/cancelled mutation, or fulfillment deduction flows.

## Critical Blockers

| Blocker | Risk | Required Outcome | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| User-visible jobs can be process-local | Render restart can lose job status for print queue/rate backfill/ref-rate fetch | Durable job status for user-visible long jobs | Restart test preserves job record |
| Mixed job state models exist | Sync uses queue/locks while other jobs use maps | One job-state policy with clear owners | Job matrix review |
| Duplicate work risk remains for some manual jobs | Multiple requests can start repeated external API work | Idempotency keys and singleton/lease policy | duplicate-start test |
| Failure/dead-letter state is incomplete | Jobs can fail without a consistent recovery path | Terminal failure state, retry policy, and owner action | failed job fixture |

## High-Risk Issues

| Job Area | Current State | Risk If Unchanged | Required Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Print queue batch send | in-memory job status with scoped ownership checks | restart loses status/results | persist job header, progress, ownership, and result summary |
| Print queue PDF merge | in-memory job plus base64 PDF output | restart loses output/status; large memory use | durable job metadata and artifact storage/expiry policy |
| Rate backfill best rates | in-memory job map | restart loses active/latest status and can duplicate provider calls | durable backfill job table or pg-boss workflow |
| Billing reference-rate fetch | in-memory job map plus durable latest snapshot | billing support can see latest summary after restart; active progress still process-local | full durable job row and progress events |
| Sync/reporting worker jobs | pg-boss/scheduler foundation exists | status/history needs unified operator view | unify status snapshots with durable job events |

## Medium-Risk Issues

| Area | Concern | Recommended Patch |
|---|---|---|
| Job result artifacts | PDF/CSV/report outputs can be too large for DB | store artifacts separately with signed/expiring access |
| Cancellation | Long jobs need safe stop behavior | add cancellable state checked between units of work |
| Progress granularity | Operators need useful progress without noisy writes | update progress at bounded intervals |
| Client/store ownership | scoped users must only see their jobs | persist client/store ids on job rows |
| Audit logging | job starts/stops/failures are business events | emit audit events for manual starts and terminal states |

## Job Matrix

| Job | Current State Storage | Restart Behavior | Multi-Instance Risk | Idempotency Key | Durable Target | Owner | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sync scheduler orders | pg-boss / scheduler status | mostly survives via queue | singleton/lock protection exists | job name + interval | pg-boss + worker status event | Sync owner | dual-worker enqueue test |
| Sync scheduler shipments | pg-boss / scheduler status | mostly survives via queue | singleton/lock protection exists | job name + interval | pg-boss + worker status event | Sync owner | dual-worker enqueue test |
| Reporting refresh | worker/reporting status | partial | duplicate refresh possible if not locked | report type + period | pg-boss or job table lease | Reporting owner | duplicate refresh test |
| Rate backfill best rates | in-memory `Map` plus durable latest snapshot in `settings` | latest summary survives restart; active progress still process-local | duplicate provider fanout possible | backfill type + date/window | durable job row + progress events | Rate owner | `npm run test:rate-backfill-durable`; restart/status test |
| Billing reference-rate fetch | in-memory `Map` plus durable latest snapshot in `settings` | latest summary survives restart; active progress still process-local | duplicate reference-rate fetch possible | client/date/window | durable job row + result summary | Billing owner | `npm run test:ref-rates-durable`; restart/status test |
| Print queue batch send | in-memory `Map` plus durable latest snapshot in `settings` | latest summary survives restart; active polling still process-local | duplicate queue entries possible | selected order ids + user | durable job row + per-order results | Warehouse owner | `npm run test:print-queue-durable`; restart/status test |
| Print queue PDF merge | in-memory `Map` plus base64 output and durable latest snapshot in `settings` | latest summary survives restart; PDF artifact is still memory-only | duplicate merge possible | entry ids + user | durable job row + artifact pointer | Warehouse owner | `npm run test:print-queue-durable`; artifact expiry test |
| Fulfillment outbox | DB-backed outbox concept | survives if table applied | duplicate send risk depends on idempotency | provider/order event key | DB outbox + terminal status | Fulfillment owner | replay idempotency test |

## Recommended Patches

- [ ] Create a `job_runs` table or adopt pg-boss state as the canonical durable job source.
- [x] Persist ShipStation Awaiting parity dry-run/apply status to `settings` as an initial durable reconciliation status checkpoint.
- [x] Persist rate backfill latest-run status to `settings` and expose `/rates/backfill-best/latest` as an initial durable operational checkpoint.
- [x] Persist billing reference-rate fetch latest-run status to `settings` and include it in `/billing/fetch-ref-rates/status`.
- [x] Persist print queue batch-send and PDF-merge latest-run status to `settings` and include matching scoped `durableJob` snapshots on status responses.
- [ ] Persist job owner, client ids, store ids, status, progress, total, failure count, message, started/finished timestamps, and idempotency key.
- [ ] Persist large artifacts outside hot job rows with signed/expiring access.
- [ ] Add helper APIs for start, progress update, terminal success/failure, cancellation, and visibility checks.
- [~] Move rate backfill, reference-rate fetch, print queue batch send, and print queue PDF merge from latest-run snapshots to full durable progress/event rows in separate batches.
- [ ] Add audit events for manual starts, cancellation, failure, and completion.
- [ ] Keep sync/reporting jobs on pg-boss where practical, but expose a unified status view.

## Test Plan

- `npm run test:durable-jobs-plan`
- `npm run test:rate-backfill-durable`
- `npm run test:ref-rates-durable`
- `npm run test:print-queue-durable`
- `npm run test:shipstation-awaiting-parity`
- Future implementation tests:
  - duplicate job start returns existing active job
  - job status survives simulated process restart
  - scoped user cannot view another client's job
  - failed job persists terminal error and failure samples
  - cancellation moves job to terminal cancelled state
  - artifact URL expires and remains scoped

## Deployment / Rollback Notes

- This matrix is planning-only and safe to deploy with documentation and guard changes.
- Runtime migration should begin with durable status writes while keeping existing in-memory status as a compatibility fallback.
- Rollout should start with rate backfill/reference-rate fetch before print PDF artifacts.
- Rollback should keep job rows but allow routes to read old in-memory state while the feature flag is disabled.
- Do not change label purchase, shipped/cancelled mutation, or fulfillment deduction behavior in the durable-status rollout.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. Review this matrix with DJ/OpenClaw and approve durable job storage target.
2. Add `job_runs` migration or pg-boss status adapter design.
3. Implement durable latest-run status for rate backfill best rates. Initial checkpoint complete; full `job_runs` progress/events remain future work.
4. Implement durable latest-run status for billing reference-rate fetch. Initial checkpoint complete; full `job_runs` progress/events remain future work.
5. Implement durable latest-run status for print queue batch send. Initial checkpoint complete; full `job_runs` progress/events remain future work.
6. Implement durable latest-run status for print queue PDF merge. Initial checkpoint complete; durable artifact pointer/storage remains future work.
7. Add unified job status panel and audit events.
