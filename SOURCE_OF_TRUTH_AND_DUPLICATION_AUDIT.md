# PrepShip Source-of-Truth and Duplication Audit

> PS-439 update: inventory has one quantity definition—the raw signed immutable ledger sum. The former stock cache and order-derived effective-stock model described in historical phases below are retired.

## Executive Summary

This is the canonical boss-facing audit for duplicate logic and source-of-truth drift in PrepShip v4. It supersedes `DUPLICATION_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT.md`.

The highest-risk duplication remains around owner-approved inventory stock repair workflows, full durable job event/artifact state, label side effects, and the last runtime DDL surfaces. Phase 11 Batch 1 moved carrier/store credential account PATCH behavior and table bootstrap logic behind shared helpers. Phase 11 Batch 2 moved rate cache diagnostics and exact/approximate bulk lookup semantics behind the canonical rate service/route boundary. Phase 11 Batch 3 added the runtime DDL inventory and static guard so new request-time schema creation cannot slip in undocumented. Phase 11 Batch 4 moved reporting metrics schema ownership into a Drizzle migration. Phase 11 Batch 5 moved the Walmart selling-fee source index fully to migration ownership. Phase 11 Batch 6 moved marketplace `store_orders` schema ownership into a Drizzle migration. Phase 11 Batch 7 removed credential-account request-time DDL and moved RLS readiness into migration ownership. Phase 11 Batch 8 moved `order_items`, `analytics_cache`, and the order item trigger/function to migration-readiness checks. Phase 11 Batch 9 removed duplicate runtime creation for low-risk orders/inventory performance indexes that were already migration-owned. Phase 11 Batch 10 added durable latest-run status for rate backfill. Phase 11 Batch 11 added durable latest-run status for billing reference-rate fetch. Phase 11 Batch 12 added scoped durable latest-run status for print queue batch-send and PDF-merge jobs. Phase 11 Batch 13 added `INVENTORY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_PLAN.md` and `npm run test:inventory-source-of-truth` so inventory ownership is explicit before any repair code is added. Phase 11 Batch 14 added `npm run inventory:reconcile:dry-run` and `npm run test:inventory-reconciliation-dry-run` so ledger/cache/effective-stock drift can be reported without mutation. Phase 11 Batch 15 added `INVENTORY_REPAIR_APPLY_PLAN.md` and `npm run test:inventory-repair-plan` so any future repair/apply mode has owner-approval gates before code exists. Phase 11 Batch 16 added mismatch classifications, recommended actions, and `classificationCounts` to the dry-run output while keeping `safeToAutoRepair=false`. Phase 11 Batch 17 added JSON/CSV dry-run artifact persistence so owner review can use saved evidence before any repair/apply mode exists. Phase 11 Batch 18 separated direct eBay/Walmart marketplace awaiting drift from ShipStation PS-001 and lets stale synthetic marketplace awaiting rows reconcile to terminal statuses only when no real ShipStation row owns the order number.

Current progress: 98%. This is not 100% because owner-approved inventory repair/apply implementation, full durable job progress/events, print queue artifact storage, label side-effect status reporting, and remaining shipment-adjacent runtime DDL cleanup still need implementation and production verification. ShipStation Awaiting parity, rate backfill, billing reference-rate fetch, and print queue batch/merge status now have durable last-run checkpoints in `settings`.

## Critical Blockers

| Blocker | Risk | Required Outcome | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Carrier/store account route drift | Save, rename, approve, assignment, or delete can behave differently by route | Shared credential-account service owns all DB behavior | Static guard now covers shared PATCH/assignment parity; live API smoke tests still needed |
| Auth/JWT duplication | One compatibility endpoint can validate weaker tokens than another | Shared verifier is used by every active handler | Unauth, expired, wrong issuer/audience, admin/non-admin tests |
| Client DTO duplication | ShipStation credentials can leak if raw client rows return | `publicClient` is the only mapper for client responses | Secret-redaction guard and live `/clients` smoke test |
| Rate cache/key duplication | UI can show stale/wrong/no rates and retry external APIs too often | One canonical rate cache key and diagnostics shape | `npm run test:rate-system-hardening`; browser Rate Browser verification still needed |
| Job state duplication | Long-running work can disappear on restart or run twice | Durable job status and singleton execution | rate backfill/ref-rate/print-queue durable guards exist; restart and dual-worker tests still needed |

## High-Risk Issues

| Area | Current Duplicate Files/Logic | Canonical Owner To Keep | Risk If Unchanged | Recommended Patch | Test Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Carrier accounts | `api/carrier-accounts.ts`, `src/routes/carrier-accounts.ts`, imported handlers, settings UI | `src/services/credential-accounts.ts` plus Render route | account workflow drift | [x] PATCH rename/approval behavior moved behind service functions | GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE parity tests |
| Store accounts | `api/store-accounts.ts` mirrors carrier account CRUD | shared credential-account service | marketplace credential drift | [x] PATCH source/label behavior added through shared service; remaining provider-specific behavior still needs config cleanup | carrier/store CRUD regression tests |
| JWT/auth | Hono middleware, Vercel handlers, imported handlers | `src/lib/auth/verify-supabase-jwt.ts` | inconsistent token validation | Replace remaining legacy handler copies | auth coverage plus live token tests |
| CORS | Render app, Vercel handlers, imported handlers | `src/lib/http/cors.ts` | origin drift or overexposure | Replace remaining cron/debug/marketplace copies | OPTIONS tests for allowed/disallowed origins |
| Client DTOs | `/clients`, `/init`, frontend client shapes | `src/lib/public-client.ts` | credential leakage | enforce `publicClient` everywhere | `npm run test:client-redaction` |
| Rates/cache | routes, services, backfill, Rate Browser normalization | `src/services/rates.ts` plus `src/routes/rates.ts` for API semantics | wrong/stale rates, API storms | [x] canonical cache key exported, cache diagnostics persisted, exact/rough bulk lookup guarded; [x] rate backfill latest-run status persists | `npm run test:rate-system-hardening`; `npm run test:rate-backfill-durable`; browser rate audit |
| Frontend API wrappers | `api.ts`, `v2-apiClient.ts`, `vercelFunction.ts` | `api.ts` transport and `v2-apiClient` domain facade | failures appear as empty data | remove critical silent fallbacks | forced 500 UI tests |

## Medium-Risk Issues

| Area | Concern | Recommended Patch |
|---|---|---|
| Product defaults vs inventory defaults | package/dim defaults can diverge | Pick one canonical defaults service and make inventory derived |
| Inventory stock/effective stock | ledger, stock cache, and order-derived sold metrics can disagree | `inventory_ledger` as canonical movement history and `inventory.stockQty` as reconciled cache; exact policy: inventory_ledger as canonical movement history; see `INVENTORY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_PLAN.md` |
| Runtime DDL | runtime DDL inventory is documented and guarded; reporting metrics, Walmart selling-fee source index, `store_orders`, credential-account DDL, `order_items`/`analytics_cache`, and low-risk orders/inventory performance indexes are migration-owned; shipment/label-adjacent compatibility paths still create indexes at request/job time | continue converting request-time DDL to Drizzle migrations in scoped batches |
| Label side effects | label creation touches shipments, packages, inventory, print queue, billing, fulfillment | return and persist side-effect statuses/warnings |
| Legacy compatibility handlers | some Vercel handlers remain near orders/shipments write paths | handle in a separately scoped lockdown-safe review |

## Deployment/Rollback Notes

- Deploy documentation-only changes without runtime risk.
- For future code patches, deploy in small batches: auth/CORS, credentials, rates, frontend failures, then jobs/inventory.
- Roll back by reverting the most recent implementation batch if smoke tests fail.
- Do not remove compatibility handlers until frontend routing and Render/Vercel rewrites are verified.
