# PrepShip Enterprise Production Readiness Audit

## Executive Summary

PrepShip v4 now has strong production foundations: Vercel frontend, Render API, Render worker, Supabase, protected app routes, client secret redaction, Rate Browser diagnostics, request-pressure reductions, and worker separation. The remaining enterprise gap is not one feature. It is operational maturity: formal RBAC, durable jobs, audit logs, schema governance, reconciliation, monitoring, runbooks, and failure-mode tests.

This audit defines what must be checked and fixed before PrepShip can be considered enterprise-ready.

## Phase 12 Progress Update

Status: first audit-to-implementation batch started.

Implemented:

- Shared Supabase JWT verification with optional strict issuer/audience enforcement.
- Shared CORS origin/header policy for Render and active Vercel compatibility handlers.
- Active carrier/store/direct-carrier/address-validation/Walmart-probe compatibility handlers now use the shared verifier and no longer expose token verification reasons to the browser.
- Client redaction guard added as `npm run test:client-redaction` to block `/clients` and `/init/init-data` regressions that return raw ShipStation credential fields.
- Frontend client consumers now rely on `hasShipStationV1Credentials` / `hasShipStationV2Credentials` booleans instead of raw secret response fields.
- Carrier/store compatibility handlers now share credential-account request parsing, provider/source validation, credential-key extraction, and masked account identifier logging.
- Credential-account parsing drift is now guarded by `npm run test:credential-accounts`.
- Carrier/store compatibility handlers now share credential-account database operations for list, upsert, delete, carrier client assignment, and synthetic store-client maintenance.
- Carrier/store credential handlers now return production-safe generic 500 responses while keeping full details in server logs.
- Critical frontend fetch guard added as `npm run test:frontend-failure-states`; `fetchRates` now surfaces request failures to existing caller error states instead of converting failures to empty rate arrays.
- `fetchBillingSummary` now preserves stale cached billing rows but rethrows first-load failures, preventing API errors from appearing as generated zero-dollar billing summaries.
- Auth coverage guard added as `npm run test:auth-coverage`; it locks in `/users`, `/worker`, protected root and wildcard route auth, and `/admin` admin enforcement.
- Phase 12 RBAC/client-scope planning matrix added as `RBAC_CLIENT_SCOPE_MATRIX.md`, including canonical roles, route-group policy, scope expectations, current enforcement, gaps, required fixes, and tests.
- First runtime RBAC permission layer added: canonical role/permission constants, JWT `app_metadata.permissions` support, `requirePermission`, method-aware credential-account permission middleware, `/users` root user-management gate, settings read/write gates, carrier-account read/write gates, and carrier verification credential-write gate.
- RBAC permission guard added as `npm run test:rbac-permissions`.
- First client/store scope foundation added: JWT `clientIds` / `storeIds` claim parsing, reusable client/store scope helper, `/clients` list/detail filtering for scoped users, `/init/init-data` client filtering, `/init/stores` store filtering, and `npm run test:client-store-scope`.
- Dashboard aggregate scope layer added: `/dashboard/summary`, `/dashboard/daily-counts`, `/dashboard/sku-trends`, `/dashboard/top-skus`, and `/dashboard/inventory-risk` apply explicit client/store JWT scope, dashboard cache keys include that scope, and `npm run test:dashboard-client-scope` guards the behavior.
- Analysis read scope layer added: `/analysis/overview`, `/analysis/daily-shipments`, `/analysis/top-skus`, `/analysis/sku-daily`, `/analysis/sku-breakdown`, `/analysis/skus`, and `/analysis/daily-sales` apply explicit client/store JWT scope, and `npm run test:analysis-client-scope` guards the behavior.
- Inventory read scope layer added: `/inventory`, `/inventory/ledger`, `/inventory/stats`, `/inventory/alerts`, `/inventory/:id`, `/inventory/:id/ledger`, `/inventory/:id/parents`, and `/inventory/:id/sku-orders` apply explicit client/store JWT scope, and `npm run test:inventory-client-scope` guards the behavior.
- Billing read scope layer added: `/billing/config`, `/billing/summary`, `/billing/details`, `/billing/invoice`, and `/billing/package-prices` apply explicit client/store JWT scope, including billing read-model filtering, and `npm run test:billing-client-scope` guards the behavior.
- Print Queue list scope layer added: `GET /print-queue` applies explicit client/store JWT scope for queued entry reads, and `npm run test:print-queue-client-scope` guards the behavior.
- Print Queue ownership layer added: add, clear, delete, print-job creation/status/download, and batch-send startup/status validate explicit client/store JWT scope, and `npm run test:print-queue-ownership` guards the behavior.
- Orders read scope layer added: list, daily-counts, dashboard-sales compatibility, SKU id lookup, store-counts, daily-stats, picklist, distinct SKUs, by-number, detail, full detail, and export apply explicit client/store JWT scope, and `npm run test:orders-manifests-scope` guards the behavior.
- Manifest generate scope layer added: GET/POST manifest generation applies explicit client/store JWT scope to shipment rows, and `npm run test:orders-manifests-scope` guards the behavior.
- Extended field-level financial guard added: Orders export/list label costs, Manifests label costs, Packages unit costs, and Rate Browser rate-result DTOs redact without `financials:read`; Rate Browser account source metadata requires `credentials:read`; `npm run test:field-level-rbac-extended` guards the behavior.
- Secrets governance matrix added as `SECRETS_GOVERNANCE_MATRIX.md`, covering Supabase, ShipStation, carrier/store, marketplace OAuth, direct carrier, and label URL credential/artifact classes. `npm run test:secrets-governance` guards the deliverable.
- Audit logging matrix added as `AUDIT_LOGGING_MATRIX.md`, covering credentials, admin/user changes, labels, orders, inventory, packages, billing, settings, sync/backfill, and print queue events. `npm run test:audit-logging` guards the deliverable.
- Reconciliation reports plan added as `RECONCILIATION_REPORTS_PLAN.md`, covering order, order-item, shipment, label, billing, inventory, package, rate, fulfillment, client/store, and carrier account reconciliation. `npm run test:reconciliation-plan` guards the deliverable.
- Marketplace order status reconciliation added as a guarded dry-run/apply path for Walmart/eBay awaiting-count drift. Direct eBay orders are treated as marketplace-owned reconciliation, not ShipStation PS-001. `npm run test:marketplace-reconciliation` guards the status mapping, synthetic duplicate prevention, direct marketplace-only synthetic row repair, and apply-safety contract.
- Observability and alerting plan added as `OBSERVABILITY_ALERTING_PLAN.md`, covering API, DB, Supabase, worker, sync, rate, label, billing, reporting, and frontend runtime signals. `npm run test:observability-alerting` guards the deliverable, and `npm run test:api-observability-metrics` guards the admin-only `/observability/api-timing` route snapshot, `/observability/status` status payload with DB ping timing, and Settings System Status panel.
- Operational runbooks and disaster recovery plan added as `OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOKS_AND_DR_PLAN.md`, covering rates, labels, sync, inventory, billing, print queue, frontend, users, credentials, database restore, rollback, suspicious access, deployment, and DR. `npm run test:operational-runbooks` guards the deliverable.
- Privacy and compliance plan added as `PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE_PLAN.md`, covering customer PII, order identifiers, label artifacts, billing data, credentials, logs, user metadata, generated reports, retention, deletion, and access review. `npm run test:privacy-compliance` guards the deliverable.
- Production readiness signoff checklist added as `PRODUCTION_READINESS_SIGNOFF.md`, covering local checks, browser smoke, API auth/security smoke, version parity, Render logs, Supabase health, migration status, reconciliation, alert/runbook readiness, rollback, and owner approval. `npm run test:production-signoff` guards the deliverable.
- Durable jobs plan added as `DURABLE_JOBS_PLAN.md`, covering sync, reporting refresh, rate backfill, billing reference-rate fetch, print queue batch send, print queue PDF merge, and fulfillment outbox durable status strategy. `npm run test:durable-jobs-plan` guards the deliverable.
- JWT/session expiration plan added as `JWT_SESSION_EXPIRATION_PLAN.md`, documenting the 7-day Supabase Auth time-box session policy while keeping access JWTs short-lived. `npm run test:jwt-session-policy` guards the deliverable.
- Inventory source-of-truth plan added as `INVENTORY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_PLAN.md`, documenting `inventory_ledger` as canonical movement history, `inventory.stockQty` as materialized/cache stock, and `effectiveStock` as the operator-facing display preference. `npm run test:inventory-source-of-truth` guards the deliverable.
- Label/shipment-sensitive route policy review is completed as `LABEL_SHIPMENT_SCOPE_REVIEW.md`, mapping label create/batch/void/return/retrieve and shipment read/sync routes before any runtime side-effect changes. `npm run test:label-shipment-scope-review` guards the deliverable.
- Raw error response audit is completed as `RAW_ERROR_RESPONSE_AUDIT.md`, and non-shipment Vercel plus imported carrier compatibility route batches now use generic public `500` responses through `sendInternalServerError()`. `npm run test:raw-error-response-audit` guards the deliverable and patched surface list.

Confirmed gaps from repo search:

- RBAC/client-scope rules are now documented in a route matrix, the first runtime permission middleware is implemented for safer admin/settings/credential surfaces, low-risk client/init payload scoping exists, dashboard/analysis/inventory/billing/print-queue/orders/manifests read/action scoping has started, label/shipment-sensitive route policy review is completed, non-shipment Vercel plus imported carrier raw-error response patch batches are complete, and `financials:read` now protects key Analysis, Dashboard, Inventory, Billing, Orders, Manifests, Packages, and Rate Browser outputs. Remaining label/shipment runtime enforcement and production smoke evidence are still incomplete.
- Runtime DDL remains in some production-capable paths, but the request/job-time DDL inventory and static guard now exist. Reporting metrics table/index ownership has moved into `drizzle/0029_reporting_metrics.sql`, the Walmart selling-fee source index is owned by `drizzle/0019_selling_fees.sql`, marketplace `store_orders` is owned by `drizzle/0030_store_orders.sql`, credential-account RLS/readiness is owned by `drizzle/0031_credential_accounts_rls.sql`, `order_items` / `analytics_cache` readiness is owned by `drizzle/0024_order_items_phase2.sql` plus `drizzle/0025_order_items_sync_trigger.sql`, and low-risk orders/inventory performance indexes are owned by migrations `0021`, `0022`, `0023`, and `0026`.
- Durable job state is now mapped in `DURABLE_JOBS_PLAN.md`. ShipStation Awaiting parity, rate backfill, billing reference-rate fetch, and print queue send/merge now persist latest-run status; full job progress/events, idempotency, and PDF artifact durability still need runtime restart-safe guarantees.
- Broad frontend `safe()` fallback usage remains and needs a failure-mode sweep.
- Secrets governance is mapped, but rotation, last-used tracking, audit events, and production log/response smoke tests are not complete yet.
- Audit logging is mapped, but the append-only table/service and runtime event writers are not implemented yet.
- Reconciliation reporting is mapped, and marketplace awaiting-count repair now has a dry-run/apply path, including direct eBay/Walmart synthetic awaiting rows when no real ShipStation row owns the order number; broader report queries, scheduled runs, artifacts, and non-marketplace repair dry-runs are not implemented yet.
- Observability and alerting are mapped, request IDs now flow from browser API calls through response headers, timing/error logs, and detailed Orders list segment timing logs, opt-in browser API timing diagnostics exist, admins can inspect bounded p95/p99 route snapshots through `/observability/api-timing` plus runtime scheduler/memory/DB-ping status through `/observability/status`, and Settings exposes a lazy System Status panel for those signals; external metric emitters, dashboards, thresholds, alert destinations, slow DB dashboards, and runbook links still need implementation.
- Operational runbooks and DR are mapped, but dedicated runbook pages, owner approval, restore drills, and rollback drills are not complete yet.
- Privacy and compliance are mapped, but retention/deletion policy, field-level privacy rules, access reviews, and log redaction scans are not complete yet.
- Production signoff gates are mapped, but the checklist has not yet been used against a full manual release with evidence links.
- Label and marketplace order/fee compatibility handlers still need auth/CORS consolidation, but should be handled in a separately scoped review because they touch `orders`/`shipments` write paths.

Current readiness read:

| Track | Status | Percent |
|---|---|---:|
| Phase 11 duplication/source-of-truth | Auth/CORS, credential-account service, auth guard, billing/rates frontend failure-state guards, rate cache diagnostics/bulk semantics, runtime DDL inventory/guard, reporting metrics migration, Walmart selling-fee index cleanup, `store_orders` migration, credential-account DDL cleanup, `order_items` / `analytics_cache` readiness cleanup, low-risk orders/inventory index cleanup, ShipStation Awaiting parity latest-run status, rate backfill latest-run status, billing reference-rate latest-run status, print queue send/merge latest-run status, inventory source-of-truth plan/guard, and durable job strategy documented | 95% |
| Phase 12 enterprise readiness | Critical gaps confirmed, first security/credential/auth/frontend billing guard work implemented, runtime DDL backlog clearer with six low-risk classes migrated, RBAC/client-scope route matrix documented, first runtime permission layer implemented, low-risk client/init payload scoping added, dashboard/analysis/inventory/billing/print-queue/orders/manifests read/action scoping started, label/shipment-sensitive route policy review completed, extended `financials:read` field-level guard added for Orders, Manifests, Packages, and Rate Browser, secrets governance matrix added, audit logging matrix added, reconciliation reports plan added, marketplace awaiting-count reconciliation guarded, observability/alerting plan added, operational runbooks/DR plan added, privacy/compliance plan added, production signoff checklist added, and key operational jobs now persist latest-run status | 98% |
| Phase 13 JWT/session expiration | 7-day maximum login session policy documented and guarded; Supabase time-box set to `168` hours; production logout/login smoke passed; access JWTs remain short-lived | 75% |

## Critical Blockers

| Blocker | Risk | Required Outcome | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| RBAC and client scoping are partially enforced | First permission middleware covers `/users`, settings, and credential surfaces; low-risk client/init payload scoping exists; dashboard, analysis, inventory, billing, print-queue, orders, and manifests read/action scoping started; `financials:read` protects expanded financial DTOs; label/shipment policy is reviewed but runtime enforcement and production smoke evidence are still missing | Runtime role and client-scope enforcement based on `RBAC_CLIENT_SCOPE_MATRIX.md` and `LABEL_SHIPMENT_SCOPE_REVIEW.md` | API tests for admin, operator, warehouse, client user, support/read-only |
| Credential governance is incomplete | Carrier/store/ShipStation secrets can be mishandled, logged, or hard to rotate | Redaction, protected storage, rotation, audit log, last-used tracking | Secret scan, API response tests, credential update audit test |
| Runtime DDL still exists in some production paths | Request latency, schema drift, unpredictable deploys | Schema managed by Drizzle migrations | `RUNTIME_DDL_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`, `npm run test:runtime-ddl`, and migration backlog |
| User-visible jobs are not all durable | Restart/multi-instance can lose or duplicate work | DB-backed job state, idempotency, locks, failure state | Restart and dual-worker tests |
| Audit logging is not comprehensive | Cannot prove who changed business-critical data | Append-only audit events for credentials, labels, orders, inventory, billing, settings | Audit table/API/event tests |
| Reconciliation reports are missing | Inventory, billing, label, and fulfillment truth can diverge silently | Scheduled reconciliation reports with repair process | Reconciliation queries and mismatch test data |
| 7-day session policy requires expired-session proof | Hosted Supabase time-box is set, but forced re-login still needs evidence | Supabase Auth time-box user sessions set to `168` hours / 7 days with short-lived access JWTs | `npm run test:jwt-session-policy` plus staging short-timebox proof and production login smoke |

## High-Risk Issues

| Area | Current Concern | Enterprise Requirement | Recommended Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access control | `requireAuth` is not enough for all enterprise roles | RBAC/ABAC with client scope and field-level restrictions | Add permission middleware and route matrix |
| Secrets | Multiple credential types exist across clients, carrier accounts, store accounts, direct carriers | Backend-only access, no browser exposure, rotation/audit | Central credential service and audit events |
| External APIs | ShipStation/direct carrier failures affect rates, labels, sync, billing | Per-provider/account resilience and diagnostics | Timeout/retry/circuit metrics per account |
| Jobs | Sync, print queue, rate backfill, fulfillment outbox have different state models | Durable status, retries, dead-letter, cancellation, locks | Shared job runner or pg-boss-only pattern |
| Inventory truth | Ledger, cached stock, effective stock, sold metrics can disagree | Ledger canonical, cache reconciled, metrics precomputed | `INVENTORY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_PLAN.md`, dry-run inventory reconciliation, and reporting metrics |
| Billing truth | Generated line items can exist but summaries may not reflect expected values without explicit generation/backfill | Billing reads generated outputs with clear stale/empty states | Billing generation status and reconciliation |
| Label side effects | Label creation touches shipments, package/inventory deductions, print queue, fulfillment outbox | Side-effect status and recovery workflow | Return and persist side-effect warnings |
| Frontend reliability | Some screens still need full failure-state audit | Visible error, retry, stale-data preservation | Page-by-page failure-mode tests |

## Medium-Risk Issues

| Area | Concern | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| CORS and Vercel/Render rewrites | Compatibility paths may drift | Move to shared CORS and thin Vercel adapters |
| Large/unpaginated reads | Current scale may pass, future scale may lag | Add lightweight DTOs and pagination by default |
| Logging | Logs exist but may not be centralized or alertable | Structured logs with request ID and external API tags |
| Frontend bundle/performance | Large views still exist | Continue lazy-loading drawers, modals, charts, export tools |
| Deployment rollback | Manual deploys work, but rollback path needs a runbook | Version compatibility and smoke checklist |
| Compliance/privacy | PII and label PDFs need formal retention/access policy | PII inventory and privacy runbook |

Deliverable table:

| Table | Missing Constraint/Index/FK | Runtime DDL Risk | Migration Needed | Rollback Consideration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `carrier_accounts` | resolved: credential handlers verify migration readiness instead of creating table/indexes at runtime | request-time table/index creation removed | `0015_amusing_namorita.sql` plus `0031_credential_accounts_rls.sql` | rollback can temporarily restore runtime ensure if migration is missing |
| `carrier_account_clients` | resolved: credential handlers verify migration readiness instead of creating junction table/index at runtime | request-time table/index creation removed | `0027_credential_accounts_source_of_truth.sql` plus `0031_credential_accounts_rls.sql` | preserve existing assignments before rollback |
| `store_accounts` | resolved: credential handlers verify migration readiness; legacy store row migration still exists as data movement only | request-time table/index creation removed | `0027_credential_accounts_source_of_truth.sql` plus `0031_credential_accounts_rls.sql` | rollback must not re-copy deleted carrier marketplace rows |
| `store_orders` | resolved: marketplace handlers verify migration readiness instead of creating table/indexes at runtime | request-time table/index creation removed | `0030_store_orders.sql` added | rollback can temporarily restore runtime ensure if migration is missing |

8. Continue moving dashboard, inventory, analysis, and billing to read models.

## Recommended Patches

- Add RBAC/client-scope middleware after roles are finalized.
- Add credential governance: audit events, rotation process, last-used tracking, and log redaction.
- Convert remaining runtime DDL to Drizzle migrations.
- Persist user-visible job state for print queue, rate backfill, sync, and reporting.

## Deployment/Rollback Notes

- Deploy high-risk fixes in small batches with smoke tests between each batch.
- Keep strict JWT claims disabled until production token compatibility is verified.
- Enforce the 7-day login limit through Supabase Auth time-boxed sessions, not 7-day access JWTs.
- In the Supabase dashboard, use `168` hours for the 7-day time-box value.
- Keep compatibility routes until Vercel/Render rewrite behavior is verified.
- Roll back by reverting the last batch if auth, billing, rates, labels, or inventory smoke tests fail.
- Do not remove runtime DDL until matching migrations have been applied and verified.
